This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-s21.github.io/Blog-Team-Save-the-Planet/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

### Biodiversity
```{r, include = FALSE}
threatened_iucn <- read.csv("threatenediucn_final.csv")



ggplot(data = threatened_iucn, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
      geom_polygon(mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = num_species), 
                   colour = "black") +
      theme_void()  +
      coord_fixed(ratio = 1.3) +
      scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", direction = -1, na.value = "white") +
      labs(title = "Global Species Diversity by IUCN Threat Level"
           , fill = "Number of Species*"
           , caption = "*Regions in white have no data")
```


### International Trade

### Conservation Funding (as of 2013)
```{r}
conservation <- read_csv("conservation_final.csv")

# Map of Log(funding)
ggplot(conservation, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, 
                         fill = log_funding)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.3) +
  labs(title = "Conservation Funding By Country*"
       , subtitle = "as of 2013"
       , fill = ""
       , caption = "*Regions in white have no data") +
  #scale_fill_continuous(low="thistle2", high="darkred",                      guide="colorbar", na.value="white")
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "viridis", direction = -1, na.value="white")
```



In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.
